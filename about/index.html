<p>There are only two ways I can learn: writing and solving problems. My first priority as a writer is to be understood. If I write something confusing, I am likely confused.</p>
<p><img src="/edo_35.jpeg#floatright" alt="lizard"></p>
<p>Here are some professional facts about me in chronological order:</p>
<ul>
<li>Attended UCLA. Studied philosophy (analytic) with a math minor.</li>
<li>Founded an e-learning company with the indefatigable <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/michaelaioffe/">Michael Ioffe</a>. It&rsquo;s extant and called <a href="https://arist.co">Arist</a>.</li>
<li>Joined <a href="https://contrary.com">Contrary</a> as Chief of Staff on their investment team.</li>
<li>Did growth work for <a href="https://www.dwarkeshpatel.com/">The Lunar Society</a>.</li>
<li>Currently researching generative AI solutions for <a href="https://radicleinsights.com/">Radicle</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/rileywilson9/">Here</a> is my LinkedIn.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m currently searching for my next role. I&rsquo;m looking for something analytical, since I&rsquo;m very happy taking a messy question and finding order, whether through quantitative or qualitative means.</p>
<p>The JDs that most excite me usually say &ldquo;operations&rdquo; or &ldquo;data&rdquo; somewhere, though I don&rsquo;t discriminate by title. Organization-wise, I&rsquo;d love to work at a Series A+ startup.</p>
<p>Feel free to email me about anything (seriously!). I respond within 24 hours.</p>
